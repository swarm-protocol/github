## 2026-02-08 - Preserving Abstractions in Performance Optimizations
**Learning:** When optimizing for performance (e.g., batching operations), it is critical to preserve existing code abstractions. Bypassing a function that handles specific logic (even if it's currently simple) can lead to regressions and maintenance issues if that function is later updated with necessary prerequisites (like repository registration or GPG key setup).
**Action:** Instead of bypassing functions to achieve batching, refactor them into "preparation" and "execution" phases. This allows batching the execution phase while still running the necessary preparation for each component.
